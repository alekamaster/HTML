                <p><em>The history of Huatulco</em> goes back to pre-Hispanic times when it was a small port used by indigenous groups and later by Spanish explorers. Today it is known as a modern tourist spot that keeps a balance between nature and development.</p>

                <p>There are many things to do in Huatulco. Visitors can swim, snorkel, and explore the coral reefs. The national park nearby protects forests and wildlife, making it perfect for hiking and eco-tourism.</p>

                <p>What I liked the most about Huatulco was the mix of peaceful beaches and friendly people. It feels less crowded than other destinations in Mexico, and it’s a place where you can relax and enjoy nature.</p>
