            <p>Hi, welcome to my travel site. I made this page to share some of the places. I have visited and the experiences I had there.</p>

            <p>I think traveling is fun because you get to see how people live in different parts of the world. Even small details like the food or the streets feel very different from home.</p>
            <p>For me, every trip is a chance to learn something new. Sometimes it’s about history, sometimes it’s about culture, and other times it’s just enjoying the views and relaxing.</p><img src="https://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/cultura-de-mexico-depositphotos-900x596.jpg" width="400">
            <p>This site has two pages: this home page and another page where I talk about one of my favorite places I have been to. Hope you like it.</p>
