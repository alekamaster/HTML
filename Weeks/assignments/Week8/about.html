        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>New London Homes & Realty opened its doors in 1998 with one goal: to give our town an agency that truly understood local life. Founders Janet and Paul Andersen believed that good real estate work wasn’t about fancy offices — it was about community trust and clear communication.</p>

        <p>From those early days on Main Street to today’s full-service office, we’ve stayed loyal to our roots. Our agents live here, raise families here, and cheer at Friday night games here. We know which roads flood after heavy rain, which blocks have the friendliest neighbors, and which bakeries sell the best pies after closing day.</p>

        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <p><strong>Honesty.</strong> No hidden clauses or surprise fees. Just straight answers and real advice.</p>
        <p><strong>Local Knowledge.</strong> We focus exclusively on single-family homes in New London and the surrounding area. No corporate towers or commercial deals — just houses worth calling home.</p>
        <p><strong>Service.</strong> Buying or selling can be stressful. We do the worrying so you don’t have to.</p>
